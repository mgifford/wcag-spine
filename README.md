# WCAG Spine

> An interactive GitHub Pages dashboard that visualises the "Mirror Spine" of
> WCAG 2.2 — bridging Responsibility (ARRM) and Technical Testing
> (ACT, Axe-core, Alfa, Trusted Tester) for every Success Criterion.

> [!WARNING]
> **🚧 Experimental — AI-assisted code, not yet fully validated**
>
> The **code** for this site (HTML/CSS/JS frontend, Python data-pipeline, CI workflows,
> and documentation) was largely written with AI assistance. The **source data** — WCAG
> 2.2 Success Criteria, ACT Rules, Axe-core/Alfa rule IDs, ARRM roles, and Trusted
> Tester steps — comes directly from authoritative W3C and DHS sources (see
> [Data Sources](#data-sources-) below) and is **not** AI-generated.
>
> Automated tests (Playwright + Axe-core, Lighthouse CI, and Python unit tests) run on
> every commit and are listed in [Testing & Accessibility Audits](#testing--accessibility-audits).
> However, the full codebase has **not** yet received a comprehensive human code review,
> and real-world edge cases may not be covered. Use with appropriate caution.
>
> - Impacts may vary significantly depending on where and how the tool is implemented.
> - People with experience conducting studies on accessibility impact and the cost of
>   AI cycles should be involved in any evaluation or adoption decisions.
> - **Please provide feedback in the
>   [issue queue](https://github.com/mgifford/wcag-spine/issues)** if you have
>   positive or negative results from using this tool. Include links and references so
>   that claims can be discussed and verified.

## What It Shows <a href="#what-it-shows" aria-label="Link to What It Shows section">#</a>

For every WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion (1.1.1 → 4.1.3) the dashboard renders a
"vertebra" — a three-part view of:

| Side | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Centre** (spine) | SC number, title, conformance level |
| **Left** 🤖 Automation | ACT Rule IDs · Axe-core rule IDs · Alfa rule IDs |
| **Right** 👤 Human | ARRM responsibility roles · Trusted Tester procedure steps |

### Five views <a href="#five-views" aria-label="Link to Five views section">#</a>

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Cards** | Responsive card grid — the default view |
| **Spine** | Interactive HTML/CSS "vertebra" graph |
| **Table** | Sortable/scannable data table |
| **ACT Rules** | Browse by ACT rule ID, showing engine implementations |
| **Coverage** | Automation coverage statistics and testing methodology |

### Filters <a href="#filters" aria-label="Link to Filters section">#</a>

- **Level** — A / AA / AAA
- **Role** — filter by ARRM responsibility (e.g. *Visual Design*)
- **Automation** — Any · Partial · Full (all 3 engines) · None (0%)
- **Search** — free-text search on SC number or keyword

## Running the Sync Script Locally <a href="#running-the-sync-script-locally" aria-label="Link to Running the Sync Script Locally section">#</a>

```bash
# No third-party dependencies — uses only the Python standard library
python scripts/sync_data.py
```

The script:
1. Downloads the latest ARRM CSV and ACT Rules mapping JSON from W3C / GitHub.
2. Merges them by SC number into `data/master_spine.json`.
3. Prints a summary of how many mappings were updated.

## GitHub Pages Setup <a href="#github-pages-setup" aria-label="Link to GitHub Pages Setup section">#</a>

1. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
2. Set **Source** to *GitHub Actions*.
3. Push to `main` — the workflow deploys automatically.

The daily `sync_accessibility.yml` workflow also re-deploys after updating
`master_spine.json`.

---

## Contributing <a href="#contributing" aria-label="Link to Contributing section">#</a>

Pull requests are welcome! To add or correct a rule mapping:

1. Edit `data/master_spine.json` directly, **or**
2. Update `scripts/sync_data.py` if the source data format changes.

---

## Testing & Accessibility Audits
To maintain our commitment to WCAG 2.2 AA, developers must run local audits:

1. **Install tools**: `npm install`
2. **Run All Audits**: `npm run test:a11y`
   - Runs **Playwright + Axe-core** in both Light and Dark modes.
   - Runs **Lighthouse CI** to ensure an accessibility score of 100%.

## AI Disclosure <a href="#ai-disclosure" aria-label="Link to AI Disclosure section">#</a>

Transparency about AI use is a core commitment of this project. Below is a record of every AI tool
that has been used, and how it was used. If you contribute using an AI tool, please add it to this
table (see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for instructions).

### What AI did — and did not — generate

To answer the natural question *"which parts of this project are AI-generated?"*:

| Layer | AI-generated? | Notes |
|-------|:---:|-------|
| **Source data** (WCAG 2.2 SCs, ACT Rules, Axe-core/Alfa IDs, ARRM roles, Trusted Tester steps) | ❌ No | Fetched directly from authoritative W3C and DHS sources by the sync script |
| **Data-pipeline code** (`scripts/sync_data.py`, CI workflows) | ✅ Yes | Written with AI assistance; covered by Python unit tests in `tests/` |
| **Frontend code** (`index.html`, `assets/js/app.js`, `assets/css/style.css`) | ✅ Yes | Written with AI assistance; covered by Playwright + Axe-core + Lighthouse CI |
| **Documentation** (`README.md`, `ACCESSIBILITY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) | ✅ Yes | Authored with AI assistance; reviewed and edited by the project maintainer |

### Human review & testing

The following safeguards are in place for AI-generated code:

- **Automated CI** runs on every commit: Playwright + Axe-core (0 violations required), Lighthouse CI (100% accessibility score required), and Python unit tests (`python3 -m pytest`).
- **Daily data sync** re-runs `sync_data.py` against live W3C/DHS endpoints and redeploys; failures are visible in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/mgifford/wcag-spine/actions).
- **Maintainer review** — all AI-generated PRs are reviewed by the project maintainer before merging.
- **Not yet fully audited** — a comprehensive independent human code review of the full codebase has not yet been completed. Contributions and reviews are welcome via the [issue queue](https://github.com/mgifford/wcag-spine/issues).

### AI tools used in development

| Tool | Layer(s) affected | Role |
|------|:---:|------|
| **GitHub Copilot** (Coding Agent / `copilot-swe-agent`) | Frontend · Data pipeline · Documentation | Code generation, documentation authoring, PR automation, and project scaffolding throughout the build of this project |
| **Antigravity** (AI Coding Assistant) | Frontend · Data pipeline | Removal of MermaidJS dependency; Implementation of pure HTML/CSS Spine View and data flow visualisations; Implementation of live Trusted Tester v5 scraper and data provenance source badges; Implementation of theme-aware (Light/Dark) accessibility CI/CD pipeline (Playwright + Axe-core + Lighthouse); Remediation of WCAG 2.2 AA violations (contrast, nested interactive, target-size) |

### Runtime AI

**None.** The dashboard is a fully static site. When a user opens the application, no LLM or
AI API is called. All data is pre-built by the daily CI sync script and served as a static JSON
file (`data/master_spine.json`).

### Browser-based AI

**None.** No on-device or browser-based AI features are present. The frontend (`app.js`) does not
load any AI SDK, call any inference endpoint, or delegate any logic to a browser AI API.
